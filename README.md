## 🐞 Known Issues
- Level HUD may lag behind actual `gameLevel.value` updates occasionally
- Level-up triggers only after clearing obstacles; fragments lingering may delay progression
- Sound effects sometimes linger briefly after pausing due to race conditions
- Rare bullet-asteroid simultaneous collision glitches

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- Rotating and animated asteroids with canvas transforms
- Starfield and other animated backgrounds for immersion
- Spaceship glow trails and enhanced thrust effects
- Pattern-based asteroid swarms or AI-controlled enemies
- Persistent high score leaderboard (localStorage or cloud sync)
- Full mobile optimization and touch controls refinement

---

## ✅ Status
Complete core gameplay with responsive design, sound management, and polished visuals. Modular architecture for easy expansion and maintenance. Ready for deployment or further feature development.

Fly safe, Captain! 🛸
