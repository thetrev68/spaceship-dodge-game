## 🐞 Known Issues
- Level HUD may lag behind actual `gameLevel.value` updates occasionally
- Level-up triggers only after clearing obstacles; fragments lingering may delay progression
- Sound effects sometimes linger briefly after pausing due to race conditions
- Rare bullet-asteroid simultaneous collision glitches

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
Here are some practical next-step enhancement ideas:

### Gameplay Enhancements

* **Rotating Asteroids:** Add smooth rotation to asteroids for visual interest.
* **Asteroid Trails:** Add particle effects or subtle trails behind fast asteroids.
* **Power-ups:** Introduce pickups like shields, rapid fire, or score multipliers.
* **Enemy Ships:** Add AI-controlled enemy ships with simple behaviors.

### Visual/UI Improvements

* **Animated Starfield:** Background stars that slowly move to simulate space.
* **Spaceship Glow/Trail:** Dynamic glowing engine trails that pulse or flicker.
* **Damage Effects:** Flash or shake canvas when player takes damage.

### Audio & Feedback

* **Dynamic Music:** Change music intensity or layers with game level or events.
* **Voice/SFX Overlays:** Add simple voice lines or alerts (e.g., “Level Up!”).
* **More Audio Controls:** Per-effect volume sliders or audio presets.

### UX & Polish

* **Pause Menu:** More detailed pause menu with options like restart, quit, settings.
* **Mobile UX:** Gesture support, on-screen joystick/buttons.
* **High Score & Stats:** Persistent local storage for best scores and play stats.

### Technical

* **Save/Load:** Save player progress or preferences locally.
* **Performance Metrics:** Show FPS or memory usage for debugging.
* **Accessibility:** Colorblind modes, larger UI elements, remappable controls.
