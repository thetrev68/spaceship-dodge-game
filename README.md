# 🚀 Spaceship Dodge

A fast-paced arcade-style browser game where you pilot a glowing vector spaceship, dodge and shoot asteroids, and level up against rising difficulty. Built with JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite — supports mouse, keyboard, and full touch/mobile controls with layered audio effects.

**Recently refactored to a modular, domain-driven architecture with TypeScript for better scalability and maintainability.**

## ✨ Features

- ✈️ **Vector-style spaceship** with animated thruster glow
- ☄️ **Asteroids of multiple sizes** that break into fragments, with score bonuses

- 💬 **Floating score popups** on hits and bonuses
- 🔊 **Full audio management**:
  - Background music
  - Laser/break/levelup/gameover effects
  - Volume slider & mute/unmute toggle
- ❤️ **3-lives system** with overlay transitions and continue support
- 📱 **Mobile support**:
  - Tap/drag to move and shoot
  - Pause on release
  - Touch resume and floating button support
- ⌨️ **Desktop support**:
  - Mouse, WASD, arrows, spacebar
  - Right-click or `P` to pause/resume
- 🖥️ **Responsive canvas** with fullscreen scaling
- 🎯 **Level-up every ~15 seconds** with obstacle-clear gating
- 🚦 **Mobile performance optimizations** — FPS capping, capped spawns
- 🛑 **Quit confirmation** when exiting during pause

## 🏗️ Architecture & File Structure

The codebase follows a modular, domain-driven structure. Path aliases (e.g., `@core`, `@game`) are used for cleaner imports.

For a detailed breakdown, see [FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md](./FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md).

```plaintext
src/
├── core/           # Application bootstrap, global state, configuration
├── game/           # Game loop, state machine, level progression
├── entities/       # Game objects (player, asteroids, bullets, powerups)
├── systems/        # Cross-cutting concerns (collision, rendering, audio)
├── input/          # Input handling (desktop, mobile)
├── ui/             # User interface components
│   ├── overlays/   # Game overlays (start, pause, level transition)
│   ├── hud/        # Heads-up display (score, lives)
│   └── controls/   # UI controls (audio)
├── effects/        # Visual effects (starfield)
└── utils/          # Pure utility functions (math, canvas, platform)
```

### Key Modules
- **Core**: `main.ts` (entry), `state.ts` (global state), `constants.ts` (config), `logger.ts`
- **Game**: `gameLoop.ts` (loop), `gameStateManager.ts` (state machine), `flowManager.ts`
- **Systems**: `collisionHandler.ts` (spatial grid), `renderManager.ts`, `soundManager.ts`
- **Entities**: `player.ts`, `asteroid.ts`, `bullet.ts`, `powerup.ts`

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements (v1.1.0+)

Recent updates focus on performance, stability, and code quality. See [UPGRADE_NOTES.md](./UPGRADE_NOTES.md) for details.

*   **Modular Architecture**: Domain-specific modules (Entities, Systems, UI, etc.).
*   **Spatial Partitioning**: Spatial grid for O(n) collision detection with many objects.
*   **DOM Helpers**: Typed helpers for safer overlay/input handling.
*   **TypeScript Migration**: Core, systems, entities, and UI/input layers now typed end-to-end.
*   **Tailwind CSS v4**: Upgraded for smaller builds and better performance.
*   **Constants Centralization**: All magic numbers in `core/constants.ts` for easy tuning.
*   **Bug Fixes**: Safer audio unlocking, collision array mutations, and overlay focus handling.

---

## 🐞 Known Issues

* Level-up waits until all fragments are cleared (intended but sometimes feels delayed).
* If game is paused at exact collision frame, rare scoring overlap occurs.
* Background music requires user interaction to start (browser policy) — handled via silent unlock, but may still be silent initially on some devices.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Gameplay

* 🌀 Rotating asteroids with angular momentum
* 🛡️ Shields, rapid fire, score multipliers
* 🚀 Enemy ships with pathfinding AI
* 💥 Explosive chain reactions

### Visual Polish

* 🌌 Starfield and depth scrolling (expanded beyond `@effects/starfield.ts`)
* ✨ Particle thrust trails
* 📳 Screen shake on hit/death

### Audio

* 🎼 Layered dynamic music based on level/intensity
* 🎚️ Per-sound sliders in audio menu
* 🗣️ Voiceovers: "Level Up!", "Shield Activated", etc.

### Technical

* 📊 FPS display toggle (dev mode)
* ♿ Accessibility: remappable keys, visual assist modes
* 📈 Performance reporting/logging tools
